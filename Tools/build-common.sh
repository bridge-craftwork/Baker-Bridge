# build-common.sh - shared configuration and helpers for the Baker Bridge build.
#
# Sourced by both halves of the build; not runnable on its own.
#
#   build-deals.sh      the deal set   (HTML -> BakerBridgeFull.csv)
#   build-materials.sh  the packaging  (BakerBridgeFull.csv -> the published trees)
#
# The two are split because they have opposite characters. build-deals.sh generates and
# fills hands, so it can produce a *different deal set* on each run -- bb_fill's E/W
# assignment is an unseeded shuffle -- and changing the deals changes board identity
# ([VersionToken]), which Bridge Classroom keys mastery and problem reports off. It is
# therefore run rarely and deliberately. build-materials.sh is a pure function of the CSV:
# the same input yields byte-identical output, so it can be re-run freely whenever the
# packaging changes.

# Build folder layout (issue #21, Phase B). The merge+stamp+manifest steps write the
# shared master, Collection/ (replacing Package/'s old role; Package/ is a frozen orphan).
# Two exports diverge from Collection/ — they are NOT chained through each other:
#   - bridge-classroom/  the app's contracted files (control-tag PBNs + manifest/toc/titles
#                        + optional intros), copied out of Collection/ by the `export` phase.
#   - Presentation/ -> Rotations/  the face-to-face teaching materials (tags stripped, table
#                        rotations), built from Collection/ by presentation/rotate.
# BB_PACKAGE_DIR points the package/stamp/manifest/toc/presentation/audit scripts at the
# master; override it to rebuild elsewhere.
